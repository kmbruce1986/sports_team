  # 4. For a given person, add a new name to their list of friends
  # (e.g. the function add_friend(@person2, "Scrappy-Doo") should add Scrappy-Doo to the friends.)
  # (hint: This function should not return anything. After the function call, check for the length of the friends array to test it!)


  # 5. For a given person, remove a specific name from their list of friends
  # (hint: Same as above, testing for the length of the array should be sufficient)


  # 6. Find the total of everyone's money
  # (hint: use the @people array, remember how we checked the total number of eggs yesterday?)


  # 7. For two given people, allow the first person to loan a given value of money to the other
  # (hint: our function will probably need 3 arguments passed to it... the lender, the lendee, and the amount for this function)
  # (hint2: You should test if both the lender's and the lendee's money have changed, maybe two assertions?)


  # 8. Find the set of everyone's favourite food joined together
  # (hint: concatenate the favourites/snack arrays together)


  # 9. Find people with no friends
  # (hint: return an array, there might be more people in the future with no friends!)
